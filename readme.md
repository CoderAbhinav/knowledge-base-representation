# Knowledge Base Representation Package

The Knowledge Base Representation Package is a Python library that provides a graph-based representation of facts in a knowledge base. It allows you to build complex structures by connecting individual facts into a graph-like hierarchy and perform queries on the knowledge base.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the Knowledge Base Representation Package.

```
pip install knowledge-base-representation
```

## Usage
    ```
    from knowledge_base_representation.core.fact import Fact
    from knowledge_base_representation.core.fact_graph import FactGraph
    from knowledge_base_representation.queries.query import Query
    from knowledge_base_representation.queries.query_engine import QueryEngine

    # Create facts
    fact1 = Fact("fact1", {"attribute1": "value1", "attribute2": "value2"})
    fact2 = Fact("fact2", {"attribute1": "value1", "attribute3": "value3"})

    # Create a fact graph
    fact_graph = FactGraph()

    # Add facts to the graph
    fact_graph.add_fact(fact1)
    fact_graph.add_fact(fact2)

    # Connect facts in the graph
    fact_graph.connect_facts(fact1, fact2)

    # Perform a query on the knowledge base
    query = Query("fact1", {"attribute1": "value1"})
    query_engine = QueryEngine(fact_graph)
    results = query_engine.execute_query(query)

    # Print the query results
    for result in results:
        print(result)


    ```

## Project Strucutre
To create a Knowledge Base Representation Package with a graph-based representation of facts, one suitable design pattern to consider is the Composite Pattern. The Composite Pattern allows you to represent individual facts as nodes and build complex structures by combining these nodes into a tree-like hierarchy.

Here's a breakdown of the different components and their responsibilities:

1. `knowledge_base_representation/`: The main package directory.
2. `__init__.py`: An empty file that makes the directory a Python package.
3. `core/`: Contains the core components of the knowledge base representation.
   - `__init__.py`: Makes the `core` directory a Python package.
   - `fact.py`: Defines the `Fact` class to represent individual facts.
   - `fact_graph.py`: Defines the `FactGraph` class to represent the graph-based knowledge base.
   - `graph_utils.py`: Provides utility functions for working with the knowledge graph.
4. `queries/`: Contains components related to querying the knowledge base.
   - `__init__.py`: Makes the `queries` directory a Python package.
   - `query.py`: Defines the `Query` class to represent queries on the knowledge base.
   - `query_engine.py`: Implements the query engine to process queries on the knowledge graph.
5. `utils/`: Contains utility functions and modules used throughout the package.
   - `__init__.py`: Makes the `utils` directory a Python package.
   - `validation.py`: Provides functions for validating the input data.
6. `examples/`: Contains example usage of the package.
   - `__init__.py`: Makes the `examples` directory a Python package.
   - `example_usage.py`: Provides examples demonstrating how to use the package.
7. `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the package.
   - `__init__.py`: Makes the `tests` directory a Python package.
   - Test files: Contains test files for different components of the package.
8. `setup.py`: Configuration file for packaging the project.
9. `requirements.txt`: File listing the dependencies required to run the package.
10. `README.md`: Documentation file providing an overview of the package and its usage.

To proceed with the development, follow these steps:

1. Start by defining the `Fact` class in `core/fact.py`. This class should encapsulate the properties and attributes of an individual fact.

2. Implement the `FactGraph` class in `core/fact_graph.py`. This class should handle the creation and management of the graph-based knowledge base, providing methods for adding facts, connecting facts, and querying the graph.

3. Develop utility functions in `core/graph_utils.py` to assist with graph-related operations, such as traversals and connectivity checks.

4. Define the `Query` class in `queries/query

.py`. This class should represent a query on the knowledge base and provide methods to specify the criteria and constraints for the query.

5. Implement the query engine in `queries/query_engine.py`. This component should take a query and the knowledge graph as input, and return the results matching the query criteria.

6. Create utility functions in `utils/validation.py` to validate input data, such as fact attributes and query constraints.

7. Use the `examples/example_usage.py` file to showcase how to use the package by creating a knowledge base, adding facts, and performing queries.

8. Write unit tests in the `tests/` directory to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionality.

9. Package the project using the `setup.py` file and specify the dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

10. Document the package's usage, installation, and other relevant information in the `README.md` file.

By following this project structure and development process, you can create an efficient and scalable Knowledge Base Representation Package with a graph-based implementation.

## About

The Knowledge Base Representation Package is a powerful Python library that enables efficient representation of knowledge bases using a graph-based approach. It provides a flexible and scalable solution for organizing and querying facts within a knowledge base.

### Key Features

- **Graph-based Representation**: The package leverages a graph data structure to represent facts and their relationships, allowing for intuitive organization and traversal of the knowledge base.

- **Flexible Fact Structure**: Each fact can have multiple attributes and values, providing a rich representation of information within the knowledge base.

- **Efficient Query Engine**: The included query engine allows for performing complex queries on the knowledge base, filtering facts based on specific attributes and attribute values.

- **Scalable Design**: The project is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for the efficient management of large knowledge bases with millions of facts.

### Use Cases

The Knowledge Base Representation Package can be utilized in various domains, including:

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Building knowledge graphs for AI models to enhance reasoning and decision-making capabilities.

- **Data Analysis**: Creating structured representations of datasets for efficient querying and analysis.

- **Information Retrieval**: Organizing and searching through large collections of documents or textual data.
