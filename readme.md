# Knowledge Base Representation Package

The Knowledge Base Representation Package is a Python library that provides a graph-based representation of facts in a knowledge base. It allows you to build complex structures by connecting individual facts into a graph-like hierarchy and perform queries on the knowledge base.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the Knowledge Base Representation Package.

```
pip install knowledge-base-representation
```

## Usage
    ```
    from knowledge_base_representation.core.fact import Fact
    from knowledge_base_representation.core.fact_graph import FactGraph
    from knowledge_base_representation.queries.query import Query
    from knowledge_base_representation.queries.query_engine import QueryEngine

    # Create facts
    fact1 = Fact("fact1", {"attribute1": "value1", "attribute2": "value2"})
    fact2 = Fact("fact2", {"attribute1": "value1", "attribute3": "value3"})

    # Create a fact graph
    fact_graph = FactGraph()

    # Add facts to the graph
    fact_graph.add_fact(fact1)
    fact_graph.add_fact(fact2)

    # Connect facts in the graph
    fact_graph.connect_facts(fact1, fact2)

    # Perform a query on the knowledge base
    query = Query("fact1", {"attribute1": "value1"})
    query_engine = QueryEngine(fact_graph)
    results = query_engine.execute_query(query)

    # Print the query results
    for result in results:
        print(result)


    ```

## About

The Knowledge Base Representation Package is a powerful Python library that enables efficient representation of knowledge bases using a graph-based approach. It provides a flexible and scalable solution for organizing and querying facts within a knowledge base.

### Key Features

- **Graph-based Representation**: The package leverages a graph data structure to represent facts and their relationships, allowing for intuitive organization and traversal of the knowledge base.

- **Flexible Fact Structure**: Each fact can have multiple attributes and values, providing a rich representation of information within the knowledge base.

- **Efficient Query Engine**: The included query engine allows for performing complex queries on the knowledge base, filtering facts based on specific attributes and attribute values.

- **Scalable Design**: The project is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for the efficient management of large knowledge bases with millions of facts.

### Use Cases

The Knowledge Base Representation Package can be utilized in various domains, including:

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Building knowledge graphs for AI models to enhance reasoning and decision-making capabilities.

- **Data Analysis**: Creating structured representations of datasets for efficient querying and analysis.

- **Information Retrieval**: Organizing and searching through large collections of documents or textual data.

### Getting Started
